# Python Mondrian Painting Image Generator
This was my final assignment for my Introduction To Problem Solving Using Computer Programming (Python) course.

It uses recursion to generate an image based off Piet Mondrian's iconic paintings using easily tweakable variables to manipulate the generated image in multiple ways, utilizing John Zelle's graphics py library.

Included are 4 python files with variables tweaked for different image results, and a 5th version I made on my own, using this project to learn the basics of asynchronous programming in Python.
